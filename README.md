# sql-challenge
This task is a research project on employees of a corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files. In this assignment, I will design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data.
